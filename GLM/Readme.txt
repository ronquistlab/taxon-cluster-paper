There are two versions of the script for creation of the generalised linear model (GLM), and two input files associated with these scripts. One version has the two "species complex" clusters (that have uncertain species boundaries) classified as validated (input GLMmatrixSCpass.csv, script GLMwithSCpass.R), the other with them as not-validated (input GLMmatrixSCfail.csv, script GLMwithSCfail.R).
